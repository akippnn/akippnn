      <p>
        I go by the name Aki online.<br>
        Currently studying my first year of Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering BSCpE.<br>
        My website is coming really, really soon. Hopefully.
      </p>
      <p>I don't have a lot to show as of right now, but feel free to check the pinned repositories, I'm currently working on these projects.</p>
      <p>This readme is a work-in-progress. I'm still finding ways to stylize it, maybe with something like an HTML2SVG, but we'll see.<br><span>&#8203;</span></p>

      <p>Out of my childhood passion to make a game, I started off by making overhaul and visual modding projects Five Nights at Freddy's and other project overhauls since I was 12. It wasn't a massive project but it was ambitious for someone who never had a background in programming or didn't have the patience to read through tutorials. It wasn't an impressive project either, but despite the inner workings of the project, one thing in common was that they had good attention to detail (interaction-wise).</p>
      <p>I also used to do Photo/Video Editing, UX design, and so on. For my field, I have experienced both low-level and high-level languages, partly due to my experience with tinkering, administering, and fixing systems (cloud and on-premises) besides my usual Programming hobby. I'd say I'm a master of none because I don't consistently practice a specialty as of now, but things may change as time goes on.<br><span>&#8203;</span></p>

### **Hi there ðŸ‘‹**
<sup>Updated 11/11/22</sup>

I go by the name Aki online. Currently studying my first year of Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering BSCpE.

I have a bit of background on programming, art and design, out of my childhood passion to make a game (but as of yet still unable to). I also do (or used to do) other things that are related such as UX Design (and other kinds of design like brainstorming on Game Design), some experience on Systems Administration (cloud and on-premises), and Computer Technician. I personally do not have much to show right now, but as of the moment I do have a lot of things that I would like to shar

My website is coming really, really soon.

I also really want to do something cool with this profile README.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<sup>Updated 03/11/22</sup>   
I go by the name Aki online. Currently studying my first year of Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering BSCpE.

I have a bit of background on programming and art out of my childhood passion to make a game. I do not really lean on being either a creative nor a logical person per se, but I can utilize both for most of general scenarios.

I also do (or used to do) other things that are related such as UX Design (and other kinds of designing like brainstorming on Game Design), some experience on Systems Administration (cloud and on-premises), and Computer Technician.

I personally do not have much to show right now, but as of the moment I do have a lot of things that I would like to share.

My website is coming soon, just waiting to somehow get a domain :P

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<sup>Updated 25/7/22</sup>   
I go by the name Aki online. Currently studying my first year of Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering BSCpE.

I personally do not have much to show right now, but as of the moment I do have a lot of things that I would like to share.

My website is coming soon, just waiting to somehow get a domain :P.
